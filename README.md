# 🏃‍♂️ Human Activity Recognition using CNN-LSTM 🏃‍♀️

This project implements a deep learning model that combines **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) 🧠** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) ⏳** networks to classify human activities using **smartphone sensor data 📱**. The model is trained on the **UCI HAR (Human Activity Recognition) Dataset 📊**.

## 🌟 Project Overview  

The system classifies human activities based on **accelerometer** and **gyroscope** data into six categories:
✅ Walking 🏃‍♂️  
✅ Walking Upstairs ⬆️  
✅ Walking Downstairs ⬇️  
✅ Sitting 🪑  
✅ Standing 🏃  
✅ Laying 🛏️

## 🏢 Model Architecture  

The model combines **CNN** for spatial feature extraction and **LSTM** for temporal pattern recognition:  

🔹 **CNN Layers 🎨**:  
   - Two convolutional blocks with increasing filter sizes **(64, 128)**  
   - Each block includes **BatchNormalization** and **MaxPooling**  
   - Helps extract spatial features from the sensor data  

🔹 **LSTM Layers 🔄**:  
   - Two LSTM layers **(128 and 64 units)**  
   - Includes **BatchNormalization** and **Dropout** for regularization  
   - Captures temporal dependencies in sequence data  

🔹 **Dense Layers 🎯**:  
   - Fully connected layers for classification  
   - Output layer with **softmax activation** for 6-class classification

## 💽 Dataset  

📌 The **UCI HAR Dataset** contains smartphone sensor data collected from **30 subjects** performing different activities. The dataset is split into:  
🔹 **Training Set (70%)**  
🔹 **Test Set (30%)**  

Each data sample includes:  
🔹 **Triaxial acceleration** from the accelerometer  
🔹 **Triaxial angular velocity** from the gyroscope  
🔹 **561-feature vector** with time and frequency domain variables  
🔹 **Activity label**  
🔹 **Subject identifier**
