# LSTM
 This project implements a deep learning model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to recognize human activities from smartphone sensor data. The model is trained on the UCI HAR Dataset, which contains measurements from smartphone accelerometers and gyroscopes.
